## 📋 Prerequisites

1. ✅ GitHub account with your repository

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Netlify
1. Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign in or create a free account
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Select "GitHub" and authorize Netlify

### 2. Select Your Repository
1. Choose your repository (`osama-dev255/google-sheets-rest-api`)
2. Make sure Netlify has access to it

### 3. Configure Build Settings
Netlify will auto-detect your Vite project, but you can specify:

- **Base directory**: `frontend`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

### 4. Set Environment Variables
In Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://google-sheets-rest-api-production.up.railway.app
```

### 5. Deploy!
1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Netlify will build and deploy your site
3. You'll get a random Netlify URL (e.g., `your-site.netlify.app`)

### 6. (Optional) Custom Domain
1. In Netlify Dashboard → Domain settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## 🛠️ Netlify Configuration

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  base = "/"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Environment Variables
Set in Netlify Dashboard:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://google-sheets-rest-api-production.up.railway.app
```

## 🔧 Local Development with Netlify

### Netlify Dev
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Run locally with Netlify features
cd frontend
netlify dev
```

## 🔄 Redeployment

Netlify automatically rebuilds when you push to GitHub:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub

Or manually trigger:
1. Netlify Dashboard → Deploys → Trigger deploy
